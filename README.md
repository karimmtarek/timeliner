Timeliner is an open-source, free to use web application that aims to help web developers and designers create a good-looking portfolio page, quick and easy.

## Use Case
You need a portfolio or just a unique online resume, you need to add some basic information about yourself and what you do. You need it to look good, you don't have time to build it from scratch, and you don't want to buy a template for $10 and hack into it because again you don't have time for that, and you don't want to pay for a fancy online service.
